# Metroidvania Jones
This is a Metroidvania game with Indiana Jones as a main character.

The sprites were ripped by ant19831983 (https://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/indianajonesgreatestadv/)

The attempt is to write a full Metroidvania game in pygame using as few external resources as possible.

Concept of the game is that Indy has found himself in the middle of a Nazi attempt to summon an Elder God (of the Cthulhu mythos) to fight for them. Indy will be exploring the temple of this being where he will encounter all manner of traps, cultists, otherworldly beings, and ofcourse, Nazi foes.
